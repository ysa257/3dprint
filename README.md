# 3D Print Library for Raspberry Pi's


This is a Python library for RPi-based 3D printers (i.e. printers that do not have a RAMPs board)


## Dependencies

This library makes use of Mandoline, PyGCODE, and the RPi's built-in modules

## Usage

In order to use the library to print, the following has to be done:

1. Save desired .STL to the specified directory folder (currently refers to Desktop/dir - should be tweaked to pertain to USB directory)
2. Run 'run.py' when in src
3. Enjoy your print
